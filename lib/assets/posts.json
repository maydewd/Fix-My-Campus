This is the third robbery that has occurred in this area of Central Campus this year, and nothing has really changed.

I get that a lot of professors won't have the syllabus finalized with specific readings and topics (especially for the fall), but it would be really helpful if they could describe the workload either by something like \"grades based on weekly response papers and one final project\" or an actual percentage breakdown. This would alleviate the issue of ending up in 4 classes that have graded homework due every day/all 20-page papers due on LDOC/big midterms every other week/etc or of learning/being evaluated on the material in a different way than was expected/wanted!",

I think this is the case in most other East Campus dorms.  There were a lot of recyclables I had that didn't fit into these two narrow categories and had to be chucked, which is a shame considering Duke's supposed to be super into green living and responsibility.\n\nI've also noticed that most people I've talked to would have no idea how to sort recyclables if there *were* more options available.  \n\nI was wondering if in the coming years there could be a program (part of orientation?) that covers how to properly sort recyclables within the dorm?\n\nAlso feel like it would be a good idea to have a clear and visible option for students who want to recycle a larger variety of substances (cardboard/paperboard, glass, plastics, batteries and lightbulbs, etc.).  This option doesn't necessarily have to be per dorm, since that probably complicates things for staff, but could at least be per neighborhood (N1-N4) on East Campus.  (If there is such an option available neither I nor anyone I know has ever heard of it).\n\nThe students on this campus should be a little more responsible for whatever waste we create, and it's almost impossible to do that without more recycling options and higher recycling visibility.",

They are constantly full and paying a $50 ticket (to park in a non-handicap space when they are all full) just go to to lab/work is insane.

I now have to snail mail them a form and pay them a fee to get the W2 sent to my current address. This seems unfair to graduating seniors and grad students like myself, given that we all change addresses after graduating. Could you look into exempting recent graduates from the W2 request fee? Alternatively, could you suggest that Duke Payroll implement a new policy to contact graduated student workers, to inform them in advance when & where their W2s will be sent?",

Forgive me for the rant-y nature of this post - I just spent 40 min in line waiting to get equivalency at Trinity Cafe. \n\nLet's ignore, for a second, the fact that the freshmen meal plan is designed solely to squeeze every penny out of students, and that equivalency is cut to less than half of the value of a swipe. Is it okay by any standard to force customers to wait in line for over 40 min (I was in line from 9:05pm to 9:45pm) to get food they've already technically paid for?! Trinity cafe was severely understaffed -- I don't blame the two women working there for the horrendous line because it's obvious they hadn't been trained how to use anything.\n\nTo top it off, the prices are not as depicted. Now, 30 cents is not a big deal, but if the price says it's 3.49 then it should be 3.49 NOT 3.79. As it is, Trinity is overpriced even compared to the Duke Stores (eg: a Chobani yogurt costs 2.29 in Trinity and only 1.89 in the Duke Stores), but is it too much to ask that they are accurately displayed?\n\nSorry admins of FMC who have to read this -- if you can convey the absolutely unacceptable situation to Dining (and get them to fix it), I will owe you a big one!

      "message": "DELIVERY UPDATE: \n\nHey all, we hope you had a great Winter Break! We've been working with Duke Dining on the food delivery issue, and have a few updates for you all.\n\nBeginning this semester, Dames will begin food delivery during normal hours, and Duke students will be able to order and pay using food points. Delivery will be restricted during the day, however, to solely Trent and 300 Swift apartments, as those are the areas that were deemed most in need of food options. Dames is still working on implementation, so delivery is not available yet, but we will be sure to update you all when their delivery services are up and running soon. \n\nFor students on Central Campus, we worked with Dining to address the concerns about the long wait for food at Dames. They have hired more staff and increased training, so service should be much faster now, and those long waits should be a thing of the past. \n\nWe've also been working on changing the MOP delivery policy for times that most on-campus vendors are closed, such as fall and winter break. Dining was extremely receptive to this, so we'll hopefully have that changed for the future.\n\nWe know that not all of you will be happy about the limits of the policy change. Obviously, we all would prefer to have delivery available all over campuses during normal hours, but unfortunately Dining is reluctant to implement such coverage due to dramatic decreases in traffic and business at certain vendors due to the opening of the West Union. They're working on ways to increase their traffic, but until the market settles down, they're reluctant to introduce any other dramatic changes that would further decrease their business. While we're not exactly thrilled at that, the reality of the matter is that those are the parameters that Dining has to work within. \n\nRest assured that we've been doing everything we can to increase the scope of delivery services, and will continue to do so in the future. Safe travels back to Duke!\n\nCheers,\n-Fix My Campus",

      "message": "A very serious complaint about Duke Transportation and, to a degree, Duke Police.\n\nIt's 9:45 PM the night before classes begin. It's dark, below freezing and icy--in other words, dangerous to walk from West to Central Campus. Several friends and I just got out of an event that ended at 9:30 on West and we're waiting at the bus stop so we can get home. Transloc isn't showing buses, and we've been waiting for a while with zero buses in sight. So we're suspecting buses have stopped running even though it's reasonably early and it's the night before FDOC, when a lot of students can be expected to have returned to campus and may be on different campuses for various reasons. We call Duke Police's non-emergency number to inquire about their safe ride service for students; they transfer us to Duke Transportation, who don't pick up. We talk to the security guard at the bus stop, who tells us that buses have definitively stopped running (likely 9 PM or earlier) and that we're not the first students whose phone call Duke Transportation failed to answer tonight. He recommends we call Duke Police again, which we do. When we explain the situation, they put us on hold for at least five minutes. By the time they pick up again, one of us has decided to call an Uber. Duke Police explains how the severe weather alert has reduced current staff to just essential employees or something along those lines, so no buses and no Duke Vans. There is some kind of agreement with Uber to give free rides, but only for Duke essential employees. I asked what option there was for students needing to get home, and they had no answer, except that, basically, it wasn't Duke Police's department/concern.\n\nIf it weren't for the fact that one of my friends was willing to pay her own money for an Uber, we would have been stuck on West Campus indefinitely or until a friend could have driven us home, maybe. No buses, no vans, walking is dangerous, and Duke Police apparently doesn't consider the situation a safety concern at all.\n\nYes, the weather is throwing things off, but that is absolutely ZERO excuse for Duke Transportation and Duke Police to just go, \"Good luck, you're on your own,\" before it's even 10 PM on the night before classes.",

      "message": "We wanted to provide a quick update on two wireless issues this week that would have impacted students.  Most recently, a pair of network devices that control part of the wireless network failed between 5 and 5:15 AM Thursday morning.  The issue led to an outage impacted areas including  Central Campus, Bio-Science, Law , Fuqua, Gross Chem, and French Science. We identified what appears to be a bug in the hardware that led to the outage. The issues were partially resolved at 8 AM, and fully resolved by 8:45 AM.  \n\nEarlier this week on Tuesday afternoon, a separate pair of network devices that control the wireless network in Athletics and the Library areas failed, leading to a 10-15 minute outage.  We moved those portions of the network to new hardware on Wednesday morning, and are monitoring to ensure that the network remains stable.\n\nAll OIT services are continuously monitored by our internal performance measurement systems and we appreciate further feedback from faculty, staff and students.  The Fall semester has seen ongoing improvement to wireless network coverage, amid a period when utilization has been much higher than forecast.  We encourage anyone experiencing difficulty with either DukeBlue, DukeOpen or Duke wireless network connectivity to contact the OIT Service Desk ASAP at 919-684-2200 to help us efficiently respond to any outstanding issues. Thank you for your understanding and patience!",

However, I have had a phobia of unsanitary living conditions since I was a child due to the various infestations in my family's first apartment when we came to the United States. \n\nInitially, housing said there was nothing available for me to be reassigned to, but I could apply for spring reassignment and see what happens. Once I made a ruckus, they found me a room that fit the exact description of what I had been looking for (a single bedroom in a gender neutral section on West). So obviously there had been rooms available, they just didn't care enough before I made more noise to do anything about my issue. \n\nI still have to apply for reassignment in the spring, however, with no guarantee that I'll be able to actually have a new room in the spring (note: phobias don't go away, sooooo, this isn't exactly acceptable). Further, they are doing nothing about the fact that I cannot leave my things in my room over the winter break when the humidity will only encourage mold growth and the cold will only encourage more mice and insects to enter my building, and I cannot leave my things there to get contaminated as well and bring those contaminations to my next room (if I even get one). \n\nI'd like to add that by the time I got a response from housing, I hadn't slept in two days, and I've been couch surfing this entire weekend because I couldn't stay in my own bed. \n\nRegardless of my phobia, mice, insects, and mold (which has given me sinus and throat problems this entire semester, as it has for many other people in many other apartments) in Duke student housing is absolutely unacceptable. \n\nWhat can be done?",

This is the second time the bus has pulled up, doors closed, sat there while I try to get its attention, and then continues to pull away with doors all the while closed.\n\nI so appreciate the bus drivers and all their work -- they are all so kind and helpful. I just think a few of them need a reminder to please open their doors to let people on.  \n\nI just want to get to my mold-ridden apartment with ease.",
